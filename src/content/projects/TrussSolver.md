## Project Overview
In previous years, the Dyanmics team had tried various truss solver iterations, including Matlab, Ansys, and Python.
In order to streamline the proceess, I utilized Solidworks assebly FEAs to run worst case loading on rear and front geometries at various steering positions. This significantly reduced validation time during last minute suspension geometry changes.

This was my first FEA project and helped me learn more about beam elements, remote loading, and boundary conditions.

## Project Overview
At Longhorn Racing, we utilize a lot of FEA simulation in order to validate our design choices. However, many of our members use lightweight laptops for design work, meaning that simulations take prohibitively long to run.
To solve this problem, I developed a Linux based compute cluster utilizing old workstations to accelerate this process. Currently the cluster is only 31 cores and 128GB of ram, but there are plans to scale up to almost 200 cores and 640GB of ram.

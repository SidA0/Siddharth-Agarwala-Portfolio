## Project Overview
In recent decades, 3D printing has seen remarkable advancements, yet challenges, such as scaling up print size and increasing printing speed, remain significant obstacles. This is where cooperative 3D printing, or C3DP, offers a solution. As a fundamental step towards realizing swarm manufacturing, C3DP decentralizes the printing process by using multiple mobile robots to manufacture parts.

As a research assistant in the SiDi lab, I was one of three developers working on a phisical implementation of the swept area strategy, a method of detecting and avoiding future colisions in collaborative 3D printing environments.

Through Python, http requests, and inverse kinematics I was able to log, graph, and react to live data from multiple printers. As our research shows, this results in an average of a 30% reduction in print time.

<!-- To reach its full potential, several key challenges need to be addressed. These include ensuring collision-free cooperation, maintaining mechanical integrity of the parts, efficiently partitioning the printing job, and generating an optimal print schedule. This video presentation will introduce how our research tackles these key challenges, advancing C3DP and paving the way for swarm-based manufacturing. -->

## Project Overview
I designed, wired, and programed a portable test robot to develop code for a swerve drive
I designed linkages, gearboxes, and truss structures, creating a modular and efficient design
Drove the robot to it's most successful performance since 2015, clinching a district championship invitation.
Wired and programmed the robot to utilize network cameras with a co-processor.
